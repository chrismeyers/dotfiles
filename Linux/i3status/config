# This configuration is based on:
#   github.com/rafi i3status config

# i3status configuration file
# see "man i3status" for documentation.

# It is important that this file is edited as UTF-8.
# The following line should contain a sharp s:
# ß
# If the above line is not correctly displayed, fix your editor first!
#
# There are also Font Awesome icons used in this configuration.
# To install Font Awesome on Ubuntu: 
#   - Download the font from https://fontawesome.com
#   - Copy the files in the otfs directory into /usr/share/fonts/fontawesome
#   - Reload the font cache by running `fc-cache -rfv`
# In order for Font Awesome to fully work in i3status, the file:
#   ~/.config/fontconfig/conf.d/10-symbols.conf
# needs to exist for the Font Awesome symbols to have priority over conflicting
# system fonts. Be sure to reload the font cache (`fc-cache -rfv`)!
