## Sublime Text User Settings
Platform specific overrides are defined in the `{PLATFORM}/SublimeText/Overrides`
directories. NOTE: If a setting defined in these override files is changed via
the UI (like changing font size via `Ctrl+<+/->` or `Ctrl+<ScrollWheel>`), the
common `Preferences.sublime-settings` will be updated instead of the platform
specific file. If this happens, revert the change in the common file and make
the change in the platform specific file (if needed).
